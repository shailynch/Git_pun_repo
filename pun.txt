The punniest thing I know 
1. Why did Adele cross the road? To say hello from the other side.

2. What kind of concert only costs 45 cents? A 50 Cent concert featuring Nickelback.

3. What did the grape say when it got crushed? Nothing, it just let out a little wine.

4. I want to be cremated as it is my last hope for a smoking hot body.

5. Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
